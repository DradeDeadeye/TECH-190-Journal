# TECH-190-Journal
//Journal on my coding in Tech 190

/*
Week 1: (hours spent: ~5-7)

Had introduction to Tech 190 in class.

Over the weekends, I watched the tutorial on unity provided and thoroughly learned how to use the Unity Engine.
I first took my time to get used to the UI and windows of unity, from the Hierarchy, Inspector, Project, Console, and Scene/Game

- GameObject: is the term used to describe aspects of a game. From the camera used to show what the player could see, props and objects in the game itself, and hidden controllers that does specific things like emit particles.

- Prefab: is basically a "blueprint" of a GameObject or a group of them. This allows you to duplicate the GameObject(s) for ease of use (either to spawn duplicates of them, or use them again without having to worry about repetitive actions/coding)

- Hierarchy: is where you see all of the GameObjects that are present in the game, OR specifically in the frame where you're looking at right now if you have the game running and paused it.

- Inspector: is the window that shows the "properties" of the GameObject selected in the Hierarchy. It shows all the components of the GameObject, that be it the animation, sounds, graphics, properties, or custom scripts.

- Project: is where you could see all your assets, prefabs, and custom scripts.

I coded the flappy bird game side by side with the tutorial and learned how the game is being built.

I finished coding the base game and made some additions not in the tutorial

I submitted the base game together with a short video to show what I did in the process of coding the game

Week 2: (hours spent: ~4-5)

thougth of concepts on what my final game will be.

In the time of writing this, I thought of the game being a top down rogue-lite.

Read a couple chapters in Level Up! The Guide to Great Video Game Design
*/

/*
Week 3: (hours spent: ~6)

I continued to think of concepts as I started with the "paperwork" of the game.

for now, I wrote down the gameplay and goal pitch, mechanics, levels, and the characters that will be in the game.

Continued reading the Level Up! book.

Week 4: (hours spent: ~4)

Prepared a powerpoint to give an idea on what my game is about

the game's genres are rogue-like, action, and top-down.

*/

/* week 5: (hours spent: ~8)

started brainstorming the game's content to prepare for the storyboarding phase of the designing the game.
started watching tutorials for specific scripts like procedual generation.

*/

/* week 6: (hours spent: ~10)

continued on working on procedual generation in creating randomly generated floors in each level

finished doing the corridor random walk generation method

finished doing the Rooms first generation method

created some concept art and wrote 4/10 of the 10-pager for mid terms

*/

/*
week 7: (hours spent ~8-10)

continued and finished my 10-pager for the mid terms

continued coding to try and finish the level generation of the game

*/

/*
week 8: (hours spent ~15)

continued and finished coding the procedual level generation that produces a simple level with a single room, a level that creates corridors first and then random rooms, and a level that creates rooms first and connects them with corridors.

I started watching a tutorial and coding in creating:
- started polishing assets (coloring and animating)
  
- entities like the playable character and friendly/hostile NPCs.
  - prefabs for them to be able to be spawned.
  - dynamic animations that would change depending on the action done (walking or attacking)
  - coded stats for the player and the enemies to have (HP, Def, Atk, Spd, CD).

- simple skills that deals damage and be a template and base for more complex skills.
- skill collision checker to check if it hit players/enemies/props or walls. Ignoring if it goes through the caster or
  other multiple projectiles casted by the same caster.
- Added variants for Def, Atk, and CD for the respected elements (i.e Flame Attack, Aqua Defense, Earth Cooldown, etc.)
