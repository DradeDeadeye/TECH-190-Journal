# TECH-190-Journal
//Journal on my coding in Tech 190

/*
Week 1: (hours spent: ~5-7)

Had introduction to Tech 190 in class.

Over the weekends, I watched the tutorial on unity provided and thoroughly learned how to use the Unity Engine.
I first took my time to get used to the UI and windows of unity, from the Hierarchy, Inspector, Project, Console, and Scene/Game

- GameObject: is the term used to describe aspects of a game. From the camera used to show what the player could see, props and objects in the game itself, and hidden controllers that does specific things like emit particles.

- Prefab: is basically a "blueprint" of a GameObject or a group of them. This allows you to duplicate the GameObject(s) for ease of use (either to spawn duplicates of them, or use them again without having to worry about repetitive actions/coding)

- Hierarchy: is where you see all of the GameObjects that are present in the game, OR specifically in the frame where you're looking at right now if you have the game running and paused it.

- Inspector: is the window that shows the "properties" of the GameObject selected in the Hierarchy. It shows all the components of the GameObject, that be it the animation, sounds, graphics, properties, or custom scripts.

- Project: is where you could see all your assets, prefabs, and custom scripts.

I coded the flappy bird game side by side with the tutorial and learned how the game is being built.

I finished coding the base game and made some additions not in the tutorial

I submitted the base game together with a short video to show what I did in the process of coding the game
